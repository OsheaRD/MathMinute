## Overview

THe clock is ticking ! ! ! How many zany math problems can you rack up before the clock runs out ! ! ! 

The idea for this app was to create an arithmetic game for my son who is six years old.  

When I was in school I did a game called “The Mad Minute” which helped with memorization of the basics over calculation.

RULES OF THE GAME : :

The instructor would start a timer for 60 seconds and the goal of the game is to complete all questions or answer as many questions as possible.

> The below is to illustrate the ORIGINAL layout of the game but as long as you preserve the overall concept feel free to get creative.

## Project Requirements

You must use React.js and Redux in order to manage the state of a frontend application.
using react-redux is highly recommended, but not a hard requirement

The application must contain at least 6 React components.

Organize components into separate files and import / export using es6 modules
In general it should be "one component per file"
There can be exceptions to this; use your best judgment on code organization

You must have at least 5 separate Redux action types.

At least one component must use local state and not participate in the Redux state management
Tip: pick a small component with some trivial, ephemeral state for this
When in doubt, store things in your Redux store

At least one component must use a lifecycle method like: componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, etc...
